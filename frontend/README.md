# Frontend React Application

## Overview
This is the frontend part of the full-stack application built with React. It communicates with the backend Node.js server to fetch and display data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```
This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production
To create a production build, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` folder with the optimized production files.

### API Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend API. Ensure the backend server is running to fetch data correctly.

### Folder Structure
- `public/`: Contains the static files, including `index.html`.
- `src/`: Contains the React components and services.
  - `components/`: React components for the application.
  - `services/`: API service for making requests to the backend.
